# Getting Started with Create React App
The app has been deployed at https://instagram-clone-8cfc1.web.app
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**

If you arenâ€™t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point youâ€™re on your own.

You donâ€™t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldnâ€™t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldnâ€™t be useful if you couldnâ€™t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).

### Welcome to GitHub docs contributing guide
Thank you for investing your time in contributing to our project! Any contribution you make will be reflected on docs.github.com âœ¨.

Read our Code of Conduct to keep our community approachable and respectable.

In this guide you will get an overview of the contribution workflow from opening an issue, creating a PR, reviewing, and merging the PR.

Use the table of contents icon  on the top left corner of this document to get to a specific section of this guide quickly.

## New contributor guide
To get an overview of the project, read the README. Here are some resources to help you get started with open source contributions:

Finding ways to contribute to open source on GitHub
Set up Git
GitHub flow
Collaborating with pull requests

## Getting started

To navigate our codebase with confidence, see the introduction to working in the docs repository ðŸŽŠ. For more information on how we write our markdown files, see the GitHub Markdown reference.

Check to see what types of contributions we accept before making changes. Some of them don't even require writing a single line of code âœ¨.

# Issues
# Create a new issue
If you spot a problem with the docs, search if an issue already exists. If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue using a relevant issue form.

# Solve an issue
Scan through our existing issues to find one that interests you. You can narrow down the search using labels as filters. See Labels for more information.

# Make Changes
# Make changes in the UI
Click Make a contribution at the bottom of any docs page to make small changes such as a typo, sentence fix, or a broken link. This takes you to the .md file where you can make your changes and create a pull request for a review.

## Make changes locally
Install Git LFS.

Fork the repository.

Using GitHub Desktop:

Getting started with GitHub Desktop will guide you through setting up Desktop.
Once Desktop is set up, you can use it to fork the repo!
Using the command line:

Fork the repo so that you can make your changes without affecting the original project until you're ready to merge them.
GitHub Codespaces:

Fork, edit, and preview using GitHub Codespaces without having to install and run the project locally.
Install or update to Node.js v16. For more information, see the development guide.

Create a working branch and start with your changes!

## Commit your update
Commit the changes once you are happy with them. See Atom's contributing guide to know how to use emoji for commit messages.

Once your changes are ready, don't forget to self-review to speed up the review processâš¡.

### Pull Request
When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request, also known as a PR.

Fill the "Ready for review" template so that we can review your PR. This template helps reviewers understand your changes as well as the purpose of your pull request.
Don't forget to link PR to issue if you are solving one.
Enable the checkbox to allow maintainer edits so the branch can be updated for a merge. Once you submit your PR, a Docs team member will review your proposal. We may ask questions or request for additional information.
We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using suggested changes or pull request comments. You can apply suggested changes directly through the UI. You can make any other changes in your fork, then commit them to your branch.
As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as resolved.
If you run into any merge issues, checkout this git tutorial to help you resolve merge conflicts and other issues.
Your PR is merged!
Congratulations ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ The GitHub team thanks you âœ¨.

Once your PR is merged, your contributions will be publicly visible on the GitHubs docs.

now you are ready to make contribuition .
get set go...
